    "description":"I began my master's degree in Software Engineering in 2016 at Arizona State University. Since then, I have had the privilege to work on various personal projects as well as intern for companies in Arizona. I developed an automation tool for Bair Group Real Estate that parsed the MLS for houses based off agents’ specifications. Unlike manual searches by agents, this automated program produced results, as efficiency went up from 30% to 90%. After this experience, I realized how critical code is when bringing value to a company. Recently, I participated in an internship at REPAY, an electronic payment service, where I created business rules that obfuscated sensitive data based on the clients’ needs ",
